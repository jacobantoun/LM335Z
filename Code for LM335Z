//Wiring Info:
//Nothing is connected on the collector
//Analog Pin# is connected to the Base
//1K ohm resistor is connected to the Base, after the AnalogPin
//Ground is connected to the Emitter
//

#define tempSensor A0 //Puts the LM355Z temperature sensor on anolog pin 0

const float miniVoltsToKelvin = 0.004882812 * 100; //found this online, I don't remember the source :(

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); //initialize the serial monitor
}

void loop() {
  float kelvin;
  float fahr;
  kelvin = analogRead(tempSensor) * miniVoltsToKelvin; //converts the reading from the arduino into kelvin
  fahr = 1.8 * (kelvin - 273) + 32; //converts the kelvin to fahrenheit
  Serial.print(fahr); //prints to the serial monitor
  Serial.print(" degrees");
